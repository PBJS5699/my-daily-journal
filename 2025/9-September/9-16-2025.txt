Good: woke up closer to my alarm at around 6:13 and arrived at the gym around 6:50ish
We had a lot of good meetings with professors
The meeting with Dr. Dipta was a little dragged out, but the results were very exciting?
I need to re-read Dale's Carnegie's book to give myself another reminder
Could've been more productive, but I felt lazy after doing 4 meetings in the morning
I played 3 rounds of TFT which I regret - it didn't amount to anything and it just wasted time
I am now going to sleep at 10:40PM, which is 40 minutes late of my intended schedule

Favorite quote of the day:
" " We're generally guided by the idea that you should have a fifty percent chance of sucess = 
if you do everything right," je said. " So if you decided you wanted to run a trwenty-five-mile trail,
and you're preparing by working up to a twenty-mile training run and doing thirty-fix or forty miles
a week of running...that's not a misogi. Your chance of failture is too low. But if you've never run more
than ten miles, think you could probably run fifteen, but are iffy on whether you could run twenty... then that 
twenty-ffix miles is probably a misogi." "
