First time journaling!
Went to the gym this morning at 7:20ish, and had a good leg day
(I'm gonna try to start getting to the gym before 7AM though)
Had a good call with Onkar - good vibes. Hopefully he'll be as hard working and committed as Liam if he joins

Fell asleep at the library for ~40sih minutes because I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
I didn't have any major distractions, but feel like I couldn've gotten more work done

Favorite quote of the day:
" "In modern society, hover," Elliott said, "it's suddently possible to survive without being challenged.
You'll still have plenty of food. You'll have comfortable home. "A good jon to show up to, and some people
who love you. And that seems like and OK life, right?"..."Well, most of us live in this small space right here.
We have no idea what exists on the edges of our potential. And by not having any idea what it's like out on the edge...
man, we really miss something vital."
